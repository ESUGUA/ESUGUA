## AOUBT ME

I'd like to share some physical notes and other notes 
in English to urge me to study and improve my English.  I'm not a big scientist so my notes won't be perfect, but as a average student I hope to share some thoughts of a beginner , which may help those who are beginners, too.

## MY NOTES

I'll upload some notes about math, physics, some funny books.
